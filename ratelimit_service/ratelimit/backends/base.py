ratelimit.backends.base

Same plug-in pattern as cache.backends.base, but the interface
is shaped for token buckets specifically: a backend needs to store
(tokens_remaining, last_refill_timestamp) per key, and the consume
operation must be atomic — two simultaneous requests checking the
same key must not both succeed past the limit due to a race between
read and write.

    Subclass this to add a new storage backend. `consume` is the only

    could interleave with.

            tokens_requested: how many tokens this request costs
                               (usually 1, but supports weighting
                               expensive operations higher)
